## Examples

Publishes a test result file `result.trx` to Azure DevOps to the configured Test Suite for the Test Configuration `Windows 10`:

```text
dotnet specsync publish-test-result --testResultFile result.trx --testConfiguration "Windows 10"
```

Publishes a test result file produced by Cucumber Java JUnit execution:

```text
dotnet specsync publish-test-result --testResultFile cucumber-result.xml --testResultFileFormat CucumberJavaJUnitXml --testConfiguration "Windows 10"
```

Pushes test results to a specific Test Suite, where the Test Cases related to the executed scenarios are included. Test Plan ID is also specified for better performance.

```text
dotnet specsync publish-test-result --testPlanId 345 --testSuite "Ordering Tests" --testResultFile result.trx --testConfiguration "Windows 10"
