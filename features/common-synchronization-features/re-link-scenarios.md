{% hint style="info" %}
With SpecSync v3.3 or later all operations, including the re-link command supports "dry-run" mode using the `--dryRun` command line option. In dry-run mode, no change is made neither to Azure DevOps nor to the feature files, so you can test the impact of an operation without making an actual change.
