# SpecSync Support

The SpecSync team is committed to help you with SpecSync related questions and problems with short response times, detailed specific answers and on-line support calls when necessary.

Regardless of whether you have a licensing question, you would like to receive guidance for achieving your synchronization need or you have found a strange error that you cannot handle, feel free to contact us at [specsync@specsolutions.eu](mailto:specsync@specsolutions.eu).

There is a 5-letter support code displayed in the synchronization output for licensed users. **Please provide the support code for reporting incidents or license renewal.**

We keep collecting common questions in the [FAQ](faq.md) section of the documentation and on the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) page. 

## Enterprise support

For our customers with Enterprise license, we provide priority support covered by a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\).  The SLA for the support services for SpecSync for Azure DevOps Enterprise license holders can be downloaded from [here](https://www.specsolutions.eu/media/specsync/SpecSync-Enterprise-Support-SLA.pdf).
