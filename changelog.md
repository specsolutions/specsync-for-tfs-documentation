# Changelog

## v3.2.0 - coming soon!

\(Try new features and improvements using the [preview versions](downloads.md#v-3-2-preview).\)

### New features

* Publish execution result details as Test Run iterations with step results and the standard output of the tests is also attached to the test result. Step results are published only if the result format supports it \(currently for SpecFlow results and Cucumber JSON\). \(\#317, \#318\)
* Support for new test result formats: Cucumber JSON \(works with all Cucumbers\), Cucumber.js XML and Cypress JSON files. See all supported formats at in the [Compatibility](reference/compatibility.md#supported-test-result-formats) page. \(\#349, \#341\)
* Support publishing test result attachments. Currently supported for TRX and Cucumber JSON result formats. \(\#122, \#360\)
* Customization: Allow reset Test Case state after change as a separate work item update based on tags. This is useful for example when the Test Case has to be marked as `Ready` if the scenario is tagged with `@ready`, but when work item updates are not allowed in `Ready` state. \(\#378\)
* Support .NET 5. The SpecSync [.NET Core Tool](installation/dotnet-core-tool.md) package now also contains a .NET 5 version. The .NET Core 3.1 is still available and can also be used. \(\#340\)

### Improvements

* Allow publisging multiple test result files. The test results from the multiple files are going to be merged and published as a single test run. You can list multiple files and directories using the `-r` \(`--testResultFile`\) option separated by semicolons \(`;`\). \(\#343\)
* Support for SpecFlow v3.5 \(\#353\)
* Improved custom update templates: remove description indent, allow scenario/feature source text to be used, allow Rule name and description to be used, can use Gherkin-independent placeholder names \(\#347, \#323\)
* Allow environment variables to be used in custom update and custom default template in `{env:ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}` format. \(\#348\)
* Improve error message in case of insufficient PAT authorization scope issue \(\#124\)
* Use folder file source when SpecSync is invoked from a non-dotnet folder and improve error message if it is invoked from the wrong folder. This way you can start using SpecSync for non-dotnet projects without specifying `local` settings in configuration. \(\#342\)
* Allow setting `System.History` field \(appears as "Discussion" in Azure DevOps\) with custom field updates \(\#324\)
* Use the test configuration of the test suite if there is only one assigned by default for publishing test results. Supported only with Azure DevOps Services, on older versions the configuration has to be specified explicitly with the `-c` \(`--testConfiguration`\) option or in the config file. \(\#321\)
* Displaying release date, warn if an outdated release is used \(\#375\)
* State change \(`synchronization/state/setValueOnChangeTo`\) can be limited to scenarios using tag expressions. Can be used together with the Reset Test Case state customization. \(\#379\)
* Improve error reporting of publish-test-results \(\#350\)

### Breaking changes

* Make SubResult publish optional. Because of the improved iteration details publishing \(see above\), SpecSync will not automatically publish Scenario Outline iterations as SubResults \(sub-results are not displayed on Azure DevOps UI, but can be retrieved using the Azure DevOps API\). Publishing sub-results can be enabled with `publishTestResults/createSubResults`. \(\#339\)
* Use `condition` instead `skipForTags` in `synchronization/automation` configuration setting. The condition should contain the negated expression of the `skipForTags`, e.g. `not @manual`. \(\#381\)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Circular parent config files causes Stack Overflow \(\#316\)
* Fix: Too long examples lines might cause xUnit TRX results unable to load \(\#361\)
* Fix: SDK-style .NET project files with explicitly listed feature file references using wildcards are not supported \(\#216\)
* Fix: SpecSync assemblies have non-real date in PE header timestamp \(\#368\)

## v3.1.1 - 2021/01/05

### Improvements

* Parameters of Scenario Outlines are not visible in published test results if there are only one example. \(\#320\)
* Support localized Azure DevOps processes: set `toolSettings/testCaseWorkItemName` and `toolSettings/testSuiteWorkItemName` configuration settings \(\#315\)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Test Cases synchronized from non-SpecFlow project cannot be marked as automated \(\#345\)
* Fix: Test Run automation status is not set on TFS2017 \(\#352\)

## v3.1.0 - 2020/10/26

### New features & improvements

* SpecSync plugin support. See [SpecSync Plugins](features/general-features/specsync-plugins.md) for details. \(\#110\)
* Allow users to enter their credentials interactively in the .NET Core based installations \(\#298\)
* Allow users to save their user name or PAT to the user-specific configuration if they have entered them interactively \(\#297\)
* Non-zero exit code is returned on warnings \(\#285\)
* Force SpecSync tool to exit with zero exit code even in case of warnings using the `--zeroExitCodeForWarnings` flag. \(\#301\)
* Ignore specified Azure DevOps Test Case tags \(they are not going to be removed even if there is no corresponding tag on the scenario\) See [Customization: Ignoring Test Case Tags](features/push-features/customization-ignoring-test-case-tags.md) for details. \(\#305\)
* Allow ignoring SSL certificate errors for a trusted certificate \(\#290\)
* Show warning when feature files have became invalid after synchronization \(\#286\)
* Diagnostic categories can be specified on command line. The support team might ask you to configure this for diagnosing special integration issues. \(\#234\)
* Allow specifying the SpecSync compatibility version in configuration files. The compatibility version specifies the SpecSync version that the configuration file was created for. The new SpecSync features can be used even if the compatibility version is older than the current version, but if the default values of some settings change in the future, SpecSync will not apply these default unless the compatibility version is updated. \(\#312\)
* Allow to override Run Type setting of the published Test Run \(handling automation mismatch error\) \(\#125\)

### Breaking changes

* The setting `--baseFolder` becomes obsolete. It can be still used in v3.1 but it is going to be removed in a future release. As an alternative, you can set the working directory of the SpecSync tool. \(\#311\)
* The setting `--diag` becomes obsolete. It can be still used in v3.1 but it is going to be removed in a future release. As an alternative, you should use the equivalent `--verbose` \(or `-v`\) options. \(\#309\)

### Bug Fixes

All bug fixes od v3.0.3 are also included in this release.

* Fix: Test Case change is not detected if it only contains a link removal and there are no other field changes
* Fix: Make "assemblyBasedExecution" strategy as default \(\#313\)

## v3.0.3 - 2020/10/23

### Improvements

* `--verbose` option also displays diagnostic messages \(equivalent to `--diag`\). The `--diag` option will become obsolete in v3.1. \(\#310\)
* Display config file being used \(\#304\)
* Suggest checking the [troubleshooting](contact/troubleshooting.md) page on error \(\#227\)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Misleading error message when the SpecFlow tools folder is not configured/detected correctly \(\#300\)
* Fix: Should load user-specific config file even if `ignoreParentConfig` is set to true \(\#306\)
* Fix: When [multi-suite-publish customization](features/test-result-publishing-features/customization-publishing-test-results-to-multiple-test-suite.md) is used, the enforcement of specifying a Test Suite is unnecessary \(\#299\)
* Fix: Test cases with more than 200 history item cause synchronization error \(\#123\)
* Fix: Package name is displayed instead of product name in the command line tool \(\#307\)

## v3.0.2 - 2020/09/03

See [Install as Docker image](installation/docker-image.md) for details.
* Improvement: detect unchanged Test Case steps and do not show them in Test Case history
* Set "Run By" field on publish-test-results
* Support SpecFlow v3.4 with Test Suite based execution with Scenario Outline wrappers strategy, using NuGet package: [SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.3-4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.3-4)
* .NET Core binaries are also distributed as [downloadable](downloads.md) zip package

### Bug Fixes

## v2.0.0 - 2019/01/14

### Breaking changes

* The product has been renamed to SpecSync for Azure DevOps to be conform with the updated product name of Microsoft TFS/VSTS
* The NuGet package has been renamed and split:
  * `SpecSync.AzureDevOps` - contains the synchronization tool
  * `SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.2-3`, `SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.2-4`, etc. - contains the SpecFlow plugin required to [synchronized automated test cases](important-concepts/synchronizing-automated-test-cases.md) for a particular SpecFlow version \(eg. v2.3, v2.4\).
  * `SpecSync.MTM` - obsolete package, will load SpecSync.AzureDevOps, SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlowPlugin has to be added manually if necessary
* The synchronization tool has been renamed from `SpecSync4MTM` to `SpecSync4AzureDevOps`
* The configuration of the synchronization has been moved to a configuration file \(although a few options can be overridden from the command line\). By default the config file should be named as `specsync.json`. See configuration options and samples at [Configuration](reference/configuration/). You can also check the `specsync-sample.json` file in the `docs` folder of the NuGet package.
* The two-way synchronization has been reworked to be able to support a more stable development process. The synchronization has been split into two independent actions: _push_ and _pull_. The new process should follow a pull-merge/resolve-verify-push model. See [Two-way synchronization](features/pull-features/two-way-synchronization.md) for details.
* Tag filtering has been split to _tag filter_ and _tags scope_. Tag filter has to be specified on the command line \(`--tagFilter`\), while tag scope has to be specified in the config file \(`local/tags`\). See [Filters and scopes](important-concepts/filters-and-scopes.md) for details.
* If a scenario was linked to a test case that does not exist, SpecSync reports this as an error \(in v1 it linked to a new scenario and replaced the wrong tag\)
* The 'state' field of the test case is set to the value provided in configuration `synchronization/state/setValueOnChangeTo` not only when the test case changed \(v1\) but also when the test case is created.
* The default way of generating test method wrappers has changed to `iterateThroughExamples`. See [`specFlow` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-specflow.md) for details.

### New features

* Support for specifying test case field default values and custom field updates. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for skipping the `Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` prefixes in test case title. See [`synchronization` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/).
* Test case tag prefix name \(by default `tc`\) can be configured. See [`synchronization/format` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/configuration-synchronization-format.md).
* Support for ignoring test case steps with a specific prefix text. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for synchronization of scenarios on a feature branch. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for folder-based synchronization. See [`local` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-local.md).
* SpecSync can track format configuration changes and automatically re-sync scenarios without the `--force` option.
* More readable sync trace output. 

## v1.6.0 - 2018/07/25
