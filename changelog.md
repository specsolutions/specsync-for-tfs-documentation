### New features

* SpecSync switches to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). (#1233)
  * From this version, the major version number (currently `5`) represents compatibility range and breaking changes. 
  * The minor version number (currently `0`) always denotes non-breaking changes and feature additions. 
  * The patch number will only be used for release hot-fixes. 
  * The SpecSync plugins will be versioned according to the main version: a plugin version 5.4.1 is compatible with any SpecSync v5.* versions. 
  * Both SpecSync for Azure DevOps and SpecSync for Jira will use the same versioning scheme and the plugins are cross-compatible between these products.
  * We recommend to always upgrade to the latest minor and patch version within the same major version.
* Configuration upgrade wizard: The `specsync upgrade` command analyzes your configuration file, applies the necessary changes for deprecated settings and offers configuring new features. The `upgrade` command should be used primarily for major version upgrades, but can be re-invoked any time to configure optional features. See [Configuration wizards](features/general-features/configuration-wizards.md#upgrade-wizard) for details. (#1279)
* Synchronizing Test Cases to different Test Suite hierarchies with the "hierarchy synchronization" feature. There are built-in hierarchy configuration options (`folders`, `FoldersAndFiles`, `FoldersAndDocumentNames`, `tag`, `levels`, `single`) for the most common hierarchy types but you can also choose `custom` for defining a custom hierarchy structure (similarly to the deprecated `addTestCasesToSuites` customization). With enterprise license, you can configure multiple hierarchies and use more than 20 nodes (Test Suites) within a hierarchy. The hierarchies can be configured using the `hierarchies` top-level configuration setting. More details come soon. (#322) 
* Improved integration to Azure DevOps pipelines: 
  * When a SpecSync command fails, it automatically fails the pipeline task without using non-zero exit codes. This produces cleaner error messages. The non-zero exit codes can be forced with `--forceExitCode` command line option. (#1110)
  * SpecSync v5 does not fail the Azure DevOps pipelines automatically for warnings, but registers the warning to the pipeline result instead. If you want to fail the pipelines for warnings, use the `--treatWarningsAsErrors` option. (#1110)
  * The log file produced by the `--log` command line option is automatically included to the pipeline build logs. (#1216)
  * The pipeline output log uses colors
* There are new options to maintain "remote scope". Remote scope is a piece of information in Azure DevOps that is used to detect if a local test case has been removed. Configuring a remote scope is optional, but if it is not specified SpecSync will not be able to detect removed local test cases and could not mark the related Test Cases and remove them from the suite hierarchies. The remote scope is now configured using the `remote/scope` configuration setting. So far the only way to configure remote scope was to set a Test Suite in the `remote/testSuite` configuration section. There are more options now to use remote scope: (#1282)
  * Configure a `testSuite` remote scope that stores the information in a single Test Suite that is managed by SpecSync and you cannot include additional Test Cases to it. The Suite cannot be reused for other SpecSync configurations. This is the option that was available earlier.
  * Configure a `managedQuery` remote scope that stores the information in a shared query within the `.SpecSync.Internal` folder. (recommended) (#1278)
  * Configure a `tag` remote scope that uses a tag `specsync:<configuration-key>` to know if a Test Case was managed by SpecSync. (#588)
* The SpecSync configurations can be identified with a "configuration key". The configuration key can be specified in the `configurationKey` setting of the configuration file. The configuration key is included in the Test Case change comments, so SpecSync is able to detect and provide a warning by default when a Test Case is synchronized from multiple SpecSync configurations. This behavior can be changed by the `synchronization/push/configurationConflictResolution` setting. The configuration key is also used for marking Test Cases of deleted local test cases (scenarios) and also by `tag` remote scope. Specifying a configuration key is optional, but recommended. (#1387) 
* The command line options supports completion using the "dotnet-suggest" tool. Detailed setup guide will be provided soon. (#1487) 
* Allow suppressing warnings with either the `toolSettings/suppressWarnings` configuration setting. You an specify warning codes in an array, e.g. `"suppressWarnings": ["W5113", "W5126"]` (#1158) 
* Support for license keys as an alternative of license files. The license key can be specified in the  `toolSettings/license` configuration setting or with the `--license` command line option. The configuration setting supports loading the value from environment variable with `{env:ENV_VAR}`. You can use the `specsync upgrade` command to convert your license file to license key, but you can also ask [support](contact/specsync-support.md) to get your license key. License files are still supported. (#1266) 
* Allow treating warnings as errors for greater security by setting the `toolSettings/treatWarningsAsErrors` setting to `true` or using the `--treatWarningsAsErrors` command line option. (#1477) 
* The `publishTestResults/publishAttachmentsForPassingTests` configuration setting controls which attachments should be published for passing tests. In the prior releases both the files attached to the test results (e.g. screenshots) and the test output were attached to the result. Publishing the test output attachments causes performance issues therefore, you can control now which attachments of the passing tests should be published. The possible options are `none` - no attachments are published for passing tests, `files` - only file attachments are published (default), `all` - both file attachments and test output are attached. In prior releases all attachments were published, so the default behavior is a breaking change. *Note: this setting and the changes of defaults does not affect publishing failing tests.* (#1485) 

### Improvements

* Allow [glob pattern](https://speclink.me/specsync-glob) syntax for test result file names (`--testResult`, `-r` option) (#1071)
* Improve logging to better explain why test results are filtered out for `publish-test-results` command (#1588)
* Improve usability of file pattern conditions by hinting potential causes for not processing any local test cases (#1262)
* Automatically enable verbose mode if `--diag` is used, except for `timing` diag category (#1524)
* Console options that supported multiple values and so far allowed semicolon-separated list now allow using the options multiple times. The semicolon-separated value list is still supported. Affected options: `--testResult`, `-r`, `--diag`, `--attachedFile`, `--hierarchy` (#1487) 
* Improved error handling if Git URL is used for project URL. (#1484)
* Add error codes for all errors (#1476)
* Allow using `{test-case-id}` placeholder in field updates and test result settings. (#1358) 
* The `--testRunSetting` and `--testResultSetting` command line options are now available for `publish-test-result` command. (#974) 
* Added `skipWithWarning` and `overwriteWithWarning` conflict resolution methods, `skip` will not report a warning (#1395, #1391) 
* Improve display of warning summary (#1393)
* Detect when local and remote test case have been updated in the same way and reset hash (#1389)
* Include configuring Test Case hierarchy synchronization and remote scope in the configuration wizards (`init`, `upgrade`). (#1388, #1386)
* Improved coloring of console output (#1385)
* Improved performance of Test Suite operations (#1320)
* Text values can be converted to fields that accept Markdown (e.g. test result comment) using the  `TextToMarkdown` value loader. (#1475) 
* Various stability and maintainability improvements (#1548, #1587, #1588, #1535, #1534, #1533, #1532, #1525, #1511, #1512, #1480, #1467, #1468, #816, #1205, #1394, #1384, #1280)

### Deprecation notices

The following settings are still usable with the new version but provide a warning. The deprecated settings will be removed in the next major release.

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the deprecated settings are automatically fixed by invoking the new `specsync upgrade` command.
{% endhint %}

* The configuration setting `customizations/customFieldUpdates` has been replaced by `synchronization/fieldUpdates`. See [Update Test Case fields](features/push-features/update-test-case-fields.md) feature description for details. (#1589)
* The configuration setting ``addTestCasesToSuites` customization` has been replaced by `hierarchies`. (#1322) 
* The configuration setting `local/tags` has been renamed to `local/condition` (#1529) 
* The configuration settings `publishTestResult/testResult/filePath` and `publishTestResult/testResult/files` have been replaced by `publishTestResults/testResults/sources` (#1462) 
* The configuration setting `publishTestResult/testResult/fileFormat` has been replaced by `publishTestResults/testResults/resultFormat` (#1462) 
* The `ignore` and `forceOverride` conflict resolution method has been replaced with with `overwrite` (#1392, #1390) 
* The command line option `--diagCategories` has been replaced by `--diag` (#1523)
* The command line option `--tagFilter` has been replaced by `--filter` (#1491) 
* The command line option `--attachedFiles` has been replaced by `--attachedFile` (#1495) 
* The command line option `--testResultFile` has been replaced by `--testResult` (#1461) 
* The command line option `--testResultFileFormat` has been replaced by `--testResultFormat` (#1461) 
* The command line option `--testPlanId` has been replaced by `--testPlan`. With the `--testPlan` option you can specify ID values using the `#1234` format. (#1459) 
* The command line options `--buildId`, `--buildNumber`, `--buildFlavor`, `--buildPlatform` has been replaced by the `--testRunSetting` option. The settings can be used in `--testRunSetting buildId=123` format. (#1460) 
* When SpecSync is used with .NET 6 or .NET 7, a warning is displayed. The official support of these frameworks have been ended by Microsoft so it is not recommended to use SpecSync with these. Please note that the .NET framework used for SpecSync does not have to be the same as the .NET framework of the synchronized project. (#1471) 

### Breaking changes <a href="v5-breaking" id="v5-breaking"></a>

* Some older Azure DevOps sever versions are not supported anymore. The official support of these Azure DevOps versions have been ended by Microsoft. Please use SpecSync v3.4 to connect to these older server versions.
  * Team Foundation Server 2017 (support ended: [January, 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-team-foundation-server-2017)) (#939)
  * Team Foundation Server 2018 (support ended: [January, 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-team-foundation-server-2018)) (#1283)
  * Azure DevOps Server 2019 (support ended: [April, 2024](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/azure-devops-server-2019)) (#1456)
* The SpecSync command line execution support for .NET 3.1 and .NET 5 has been removed. The official support of these frameworks have been ended by Microsoft so it is not recommended to use SpecSync with these. To continue using these frameworks, please use SpecSync 3.4. Please note that the .NET framework used for SpecSync does not have to be the same as the .NET framework of the synchronized project. (#872) 
* SpecSync v5 does not fail the Azure DevOps pipelines automatically for warnings, but registers the warning to the pipeline result instead. If you want to fail the pipelines for warnings, use the `--treatWarningsAsErrors` option.
* The default behavior for publishing attachments for the passing tests has been changed (see #1485). In the prior releases both the files attached to the test results (e.g. screenshots) and the test output were attached to the result. According to the new default, only file attachments are published for passing tests. The behavior can be controlled by the `publishTestResults/publishAttachmentsForPassingTests` setting. The setting `all` represents the previous default. *Note: this setting and the changes of defaults does not affect publishing failing tests.* (#1485)
* The exit code of the command line tool for errors is not always `10` anymore, but in range between `10` and `19`. (#1478) 
* In previous releases when a Test Suite name was used without specifying a Test Plan, SpecSync used the Test Suite from the first Test Plan it found. This has been changed to search through all Test Plans and report an error if the Test Suite name is not unique. To avoid name collisions, it is recommended to specify the Test Plan and refer to the Test Suite by `path`. (#1474)
* The synchronization behavior of "automated test" settings of Test Cases has changed. So far when the `synchronization/automation/enabled` setting was not set to `true`, SpecSync always cleaned these fields, except when `toolSettings/doNotSynchronizeAutomationUnlessEnabled` was set to `true`. Now this is the default behavior. If you need to clean the automation fields, use the `synchronization/automation/condition` setting or `synchronization/fieldUpdates`. (#1464) 
* The scenario outlines that contain quoted parameter placeholders (`"<param>"` or `'<param>'`) are synchronized differently because in the prior releases an additional space has been inserted in the Azure DevOps Test Case step before the closing quote (`"@param "`). The additional space is not inserted anymore because of the fix #1146. The change will be applied when the Test Case is changing otherwise or when the synchronization is invoked with the `--force` option.
* The escaping behavior in conditions have changed: the escape character (`\`) escapes only a specified set of characters (`\`, `(`, `)`, `;`, `'`, `"`, ` `) instead of all characters. This helps for specifying Windows paths in conditions. (#1473) 
* The v1 hash calculation that has been used by SpecSync v3.3 has been deprecated. When a Test Case has not been updated since v3.3 upgrading to this release will cause a one-time change in the Test Case to reset the hash to the current hash calculation version. (#899)
* The console options that have been deprecated in earlier releases are removed now: `--baseFolder`, `--buildServerMode`. (#1490, #1492)
* The configuration settings that have been deprecated earlier are removed now: `publishTestResults/ignoreNotExecutedTests`, `local/featureFileSource/*`, `synchronization/link[]/targetWorkItemType`, `toolSettings/testCaseWorkItemName`, `toolSettings/testSuiteWorkItemName`, `customizations/synchronizeLinkedArtifactTitles/linkLabelSeparator`, `publishTestResults/createSubResults`, `publishTestResults/runName`, `publishTestResults/runComment`, `publishTestResults/runType`, `publishTestResults/testResultComment` (#1457) 
* The legacy [Test Plan / Test Suite based test execution](features/test-result-publishing-features/support-for-azure-devops-test-plan-test-suite-based-test-execution.md) for old SpecFlow versions (v3.8 or earlier) and for SpecFlow v4 beta is not supported anymore. SpecFlow v3.9 is still supported. *Note: this change does not impact normal feature file synchronization, that still works with all SpecFlow versions*. To use the legacy execution mode for the older SpecFlow versions, please use SpecSync v3.4. (#1455)

* Various stability and maintainability improvements (#1224)

## v3.4.8 - 2023/10/17

### New features

* Interactive conflict resolution when both the local and the remote test case has changed. The change provides an improved resolution for pull and the interactive resolution can also be used (optionally) for push. You can configure the conflict resolution method separately for push and pull and you can choose from methods: `forceOverride`, `interactive`, `error`, `skip`, `ignore`. Choosing for the `error` method can be also used to get notified about conflicting changes on the server. With the `--force` command line option, the changes can be overridden independently of the configured method. See [Synchronization conflict resolution](features/common-synchronization-features/synchronization-conflict-resolution.md) for details. (#613)
* Allow specifying Test Suites with *path* (e.g. `Ordering/Card Payment`), so you can refer to the hierarchy of the suites and allows creating hierarchy of suites. The path might contain suite names separated by `/`. When the suite does not exist, SpecSync builds up the hierarchy in the selected Test Plan. The `path` setting can be used in [`remote/testSuite`](reference/configuration/configuration-remote.md), [`publishTestResults/testSuite`](reference/configuration/configuration-publishtestresults.md), [`customizations/addTestCasesToSuites/testSuites`](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md#addtestcasestosuites) and [`customizations/multiSuitePublishTestResults/suites`](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md#multisuitepublishtestresults) settings. (#1173, #1184)
* Allow specifying Test Plan with name. In all places where `testPlanId` could be specified, there is a new `testPlan` setting that can be used to specify the Test Plan name (e.g. `"testPlan": "Regression Plan"`) or a Test Plan ID (e.g. `"testPlan": "#5678"`). The `testPlanId` can still be used but deprecated and going to be removed in a future version. (#1183)
* Re-publishing existing Azure DevOps *Test Run* for the synchronized Test Cases (`testRunTrx` test result format). This is useful when the tests are run with the VSTest task, that deletes the local test result files in some cases. The test result loader loads the details from the Test Run with ID in the `VSTEST_TESTRUNID` environment variable or from the ID specified as result on the command line, e.g. `-r 2345`. See [How to publish test results from pipelines using the VSTest task](important-concepts/how-to-publish-test-results-from-pipelines-using-the-vstest-task.md) for details. (#1166)

### Improvements

* Display unique ID for warnings. Now all warnings can be better identified with a code, like `W5133`. The next major release (v3.5) will provide further features for fine-grain handling of warnings. (#1210)
* Allow specifying default Test Plan for *Add Test Cases to Suites* customization to avoid setting the same plan for every suite. See [`customizations/addTestCasesToSuites`](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md#addtestcasestosuites) for details. (#1185)
* The VSTestForSpecSync Azure DevOps pipeline task has been upgraded to match VsTest v3.225. The new task version is v3.225.1. See [How to use the SpecSync Azure DevOps pipeline tasks](important-concepts/how-to-use-the-pipeline-tasks.md) for details. Please note that the VSTest rerun function for SpecFlow xUnit and NUnit has been reduced in VSTest v3, so consider to keep using the VSTestForSpecSync v1 if you use these systems, or switch to the `testRunTrx` loader described in the linked guide. (#1220)
* Reminder of using preview release that is released more than 90 days ago. Do not allow using preview releases released more than 180 days ago. (#1202)
* Improvements for plugin development:
  * Allow plugin Test Result Loaders to set DataRow on the test result (#1209)

* Fix: Hyperlinks included in the output (project URL, Test Run URL) cannot be opened from YAML pipeline output (#1180)
* Fix: No warning is shown when the VsTestForSpecSync task cannot remove the pipeline association from the published Test Run. In these cases it is recommended to use the `testRunTrx` test result loader. See [How to publish test results from pipelines using the VSTest task](important-concepts/how-to-publish-test-results-from-pipelines-using-the-vstest-task.md) for details. (#1169)

See full list of available placeholders in the [field updates reference](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/configuration-synchronization-fieldupdates.md#update-placeholders). (#1024)
* Local test case conditions can be filtered for test name using `$name = 'My scenario'` syntax. The name filter can be combined with tag or source file filter as well, e.g. `$sourceFile ~ **/Addition.feature and $name = 'Basic addition'` This applies to all `condition` configuration settings and can also be used with the `--tagFilter` command line option. See all possibilities for local test case conditions in the [feature description](features/general-features/local-test-case-conditions.md). (#1025)
* Introducing the generic `--filter` command line option that can be used to filter for both tags, names and source files. E.g. `--filter '@basic and $sourceFile ~ **/Addition.feature and $name = "Basic addition"'`.

## v3.4.0 - 2022/12/21

All fixes of SpecSync v3.3.11 are included in this release.

### New features

* Support updating Test Case fields that are not updated automatically by SpecSync using the [`fieldUpdates` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/configuration-synchronization-fieldupdates.md). See [feature description](features/push-features/update-test-case-fields.md) for details. (#737)
* In all expressions where you can specify a local test case condition (`synchronization/automation/condition`, `customizations/resetTestCaseState/condition`, `synchronization/fieldUpdates[]/condition`, `synchronization/fieldUpdates[]/conditionalValue/*`), you can now also specify source file path conditions as well using the `$sourceFile ~ path/**/myfeature.feature` format. E.g. the following expression selects scenarios that are tagged with `@important` and are in the `pricing` folder or any sub-folders below: `@important and $sourceFile ~ pricing/`. See [Local test case conditions](features/general-features/local-test-case-conditions.md) for details. (#878)
* Add/remove link tags on pull when Test Case links changed. SpecSync attempts to use the best tag prefix if there are multiple available by selecting the first with matching `targetType` or the first of the ones without `targetType` otherwise. (#807)
* SpecSync plugins can now be loaded from NuGet packages that are distributed through nuget.org, custom NuGet feeds or from local folders. See [SpecSync plugin documentation](features/general-features/specsync-plugins.md) for examples and further details. There is also a [list of plugins](features/plugin-list.md) available on nuget.org. (#814)
* The tag prefix separator (`:`) and the link label separator (`;`) can be customized now with `synchronization/tagPrefixSeparators` and `synchronization/linkLabelSeparator`. With that you can allow tags like `@TestCase=1234`. You can specify multiple tag prefix separators as well. SpecSync will use the first one to create new tags. (#773)
* Allow skip publishing test results for local test cases using the `--tagFilter` and `--sourceFileFilter` options. (#853)
* For custom placeholder in field updates, different "value loaders" can be specified. Value loaders can transform the value. E.g. if the `HTML` loader is used in a field update as `{scenario-description:HTML}`, it will replace the white space and new line characters of the scenario description with the necessary HTML elements. The following value loaders are supported: (#781)
  * `HTML` - encodes HTML tags, transforms whitespaces to HTML newlines and non-breaking spaces.
  * `HtmlEncode` - encodes HTML tags.
  * `Unix` - replaces Windows-style path separators (`\`) with Unix-style ones (`/`)
  * `Windows` - replaces Unix-style path separators (`/`) with Windows-style ones (`\`)
* Support Cucumber Java Surefire XML report (#795)
* Support for SpecFlow v4.0 (#901)
* Support for .NET 7: The [.NET tool installation](installation/dotnet-core-tool.md) now works on systems that only have .NET 7.0 SDK. (#868)

### New Plugins

See all plugins available on nuget.org in the [plugin list](features/plugin-list.md)

* **SpecSync.Plugin.ScenarioOutlinePerExamplesTestCase**: Plugin that synchronizes scenario outline examples blocks as individual test cases. See plugin details and usage [in the SpecSync plugins GitHub repository](https://github.com/specsolutions/specsync-plugins/tree/main/scenario-outline-per-exampes-test-case-plugin) (#718)
* **SpecSync.Plugin.ExcelTestSource**: This plugin can be used to synchronize a local test cases from Excel file using the format that Azure DevOps uses when you export Test Cases to CSV. See plugin details and usage [in the SpecSync plugins GitHub repository](https://github.com/specsolutions/specsync-plugins/tree/main/excel-test-source-plugin)
* **SpecSync.Plugin.MsTestTestSource**: Allows synchronizing "C# MsTest Tests" and publish results from TRX result files. See plugin details and usage [in the SpecSync plugins GitHub repository](https://github.com/specsolutions/specsync-plugins/tree/main/mstest-test-source-plugin)
* **SpecSync.Plugin.GenericTestResultMatcher**: A SpecSync plugin that can be used to override test result matching rules. See plugin details and usage [in the SpecSync plugins GitHub repository](https://github.com/specsolutions/specsync-plugins/tree/main/generic-test-result-matcher-plugin)

### Improvements

* The SpecSync Docker image is now based on the latest stable Ubuntu image (`ubuntu:22.04`) (#696)
* SpecSync now retries saving the Test Case if it has been modified while processing. (#614)
* Unrecognized elements in the configuration files are reported as warnings. (#806)
* Do not report items that are skipped because of scope by default. Using the verbose option (`--verbose` or `-v`) reports the skipped items as well. (#818)
* The user-specific configuration file got a separate JSON schema: `https://schemas.specsolutions.eu/specsync-user-config-latest.json` (#859)
* The type of the linked work items can be restricted using the `synchronization/link[]/targetType` or the `customizations/linkOnChange/links[]/targetType` configuration settings. (#822, #867)
* Filter, scope and other conditions are satisfied if there is at least one scenario outline examples that satisfies the condition. (#717)
* Improve performance of filtered / scoped command executions (#856)
* Detecting non-interactive user session for operations require user input and automatically cancel to avoid blocking process (#891)
* Improved publish-test-results reporting (#915)
* Improve progress indication for publish test results (#889)
* The test results with not executed outcome (`NotExecuted`, `NotApplicable`, `NotRunnable`, `NotImpacted`) are not published by default as they might hide earlier results of the Test Case. In order to force including them, the `publishTestResults/includeNotExecutedTests` setting can be used. (#894)
* The product name (SpecSync for Azure DevOps or SpecSync for Jira) is visible in the license file when opened in a text editor. (#876)
* Various stability and maintainability improvements (#911, #837, #808, #898, #880, #874, #834, #821, #832)

### Deprecation notices <a href="v3-4-0-deprecation" id="v3-4-0-deprecation"></a>

* The configuration setting `publishTestResults/ignoreNotExecutedTests` has been deprecated as ignoring test results with not executed outcome is the default now. (In order to force including them, the `publishTestResults/includeNotExecutedTests` setting can be used.) (#894)
* The configuration settings `local/featureFileSource/type`, `local/featureFileSource/filePath` and `local/featureFileSource/folder` are moved to the `local` group and renamed to `local/projectType`, `local/projectFilePath`, `local/folder`. The old settings work, but show a warning. (#873)
* The .NET 5 framework is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future (see https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-support). SpecSync versions released after 31/3/2023 will not run with .NET 5. Please use SpecSync with .NET 6 or any of the other supported platforms. (#919)
* The configuration setting `synchronization/link[]/targetWorkItemType` has been renamed to `synchronization/link[]/targetType` and SpecSync now verifies if a valid work item type has been specified when linking. The old setting works, but shows a warning. The additional verification is performed even if the old setting was used. (#822)
* The configuration settings `toolSettings/testCaseWorkItemName` and `toolSettings/testSuiteWorkItemName` are moved to `/remote/azureDevOps/testCaseWorkItemName` and `remote/azureDevOps/testSuiteWorkItemName`. The old settings work, but show a warning. (#862)
* The configuration setting `customizations/synchronizeLinkedArtifactTitles/linkLabelSeparator` has been moved to `synchronization/linkLabelSeparator`. The old settings work, but show a warning. (#850)
* The configuration setting `publishTestResults/createSubResults` has been removed, because SpecSync always needs to publish sub-results anyway for the proper test result reporting in Azure DevOps. (#801)
* The configuration settings `publishTestResults/runName`, `publishTestResults/runComment`, `publishTestResults/runType`, `publishTestResults/testResultComment` have been moved to `publishTestResults/testRunSettings/name`, `publishTestResults/testRunSettings/comment`, `publishTestResults/testRunSettings/runType` and `publishTestResults/testResultSettings/comment`. The old settings work, but show a warning. (#804)


### Breaking changes <a href="v3-4-0-compatibility" id="v3-4-0-compatibility"></a>

* If the configuration file contained entries that are not recognized by SpecSync (these were ignored so far), you will receive warnings about these settings. Please remove these settings to eliminate the warning. (#806)
* The test results with not executed outcome are not published by default. In order to force including them (the earlier behavior), the `publishTestResults/includeNotExecutedTests` setting can be used. (#894)
* The default link-label separator has been changed from `:` to `;`. To continue using `:` as link label separator, please set `synchronization/linkLabelSeparator`. (#861)
* The tag prefixes specified in `synchronization/links[]/tagPrefix` are ensured to contain only word characters (letters, numbers, underscore). (#849)
* The support for [Test Plan / Test Suite based test execution](features/test-result-publishing-features/support-for-azure-devops-test-plan-test-suite-based-test-execution.md) for SpecFlow 3.0 has been removed. SpecSync can still be used with any SpecFlow versions using the ["publish-test-results" command](features/test-result-publishing-features/publishing-test-result-files.md) (#903)
* Tag predicates in local test case conditions must start with '@'. Earlier tag predicates were also accepted, but from this version the `@` has to be used, even if the local test case does not use this prefix for tags. (#877)
* The value specified as `synchronization/link[]/targetWorkItemType` (now renamed to `synchronization/link[]/targetType`) is used now to verify if the type of the linked work item. The verification is performed when establishing new links. To disable the verification and allow linking any work item types please remove this setting. (#822)
* Test Suite settings cannot be specified in user-specific configuration file anymore. The can be specified in project-specific configuration files or shared parent config files still. (#863)
* The "pull" command now adds and removes local test case tags based on the links of the Test Case. (#807)
* Settings that have been deprecated earlier are removed now (#805)
  * `automation/skipForTags` - use `automation/condition` instead
  * `links[]/mode` - was not used
  * `local/featureFileSource/type=listFile` - use `folder` as `local/projectType` in combination with `local/sourceFiles` instead
  * `local/featureFileSource/type=stdIn` - use `folder` as `local/projectType` in combination with `local/sourceFiles` instead

### Plugin API improvements <a href="v3-4-0-plugin-api" id="v3-4-0-plugin-api"></a>

### Improvements

* Treat test result attachment upload errors as warnings: Ignore test result attachments that are too large (#727)
* Allow placeholders (`{testrun-id}`, `{testrun-url}`) in test run and test result comment (#724)
* Show created Test Run URL in output (#732)

## v3.3.4 - 2022/05/13

### Bug fixes

* Fix: XML/HTML tags replaced to parameters in normal scenarios (not scenario outlines) (#712)
* Fix: Handle PAT expiration GSSAPI error as normal error (#715)
* Fix: .NET projects with special wildcard includes cannot be processed (#720)
* Fix: The reported parameter usages are shifted in the published results when parameter list pseudo step is used (#716)

### Improvements

* [Customization: Synchronize linked artifact titles](features/push-features/customization-sync-linked-artifact-titles.md). This customization can be used to synchronize linked artifact (Work Item) titles back to the local test case tags in `@story:1234:This_is_the_story_title` format. The link tags are only updated when the scenario is otherwise changed or when the `--force` option is used. (#714)

## v3.3.3 - 2022/05/04

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Allow disabling release pipeline association for publish-test-results command with the new `--disablePipelineAssociation` command line option. (#707)

### Improvements

* Allow enabling timing diagnostics (#708)

## v3.3.2 - 2022/04/28

* The SpecSync Docker images are now based on the `ubuntu:20.04` image (#697)
* Smaller improvements for work item identity and console handling (#681, #687)

## v3.3.1 - 2022/03/10

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Test execution history is not displayed in the History tab of the Test Run (#653)
* Fix: Tests appear multiple times in the 'Tests' tab of the pipeline result when the `VsTest` task is used. To fix this there is a new "SpecSync Tools" Azure DevOps extension, that contains a task "Visual Studio Test for SpecSync" that is a modified version of the `VsTest` task that does not display the result in the 'Tests' tab. (See [How to use the SpecSync Azure DevOps pipeline tasks](important-concepts/how-to-use-the-pipeline-tasks.md) for details.) (#655)

## v3.3.0 - 2022/02/21 <a href="v3-3-0" id="v3-3-0"></a>

### New features

* Attach files to Test Cases using tags. (See [feature documentation](features/push-features/attach-files.md) for details.) (#489)
* Dry-run mode: all commands of SpecSync support a `--dryRun` option. With this option used no changes will be made neither to Azure DevOps nor to the feature files. This option is useful for testing the impact of an operation without making an actual change. (#115)
* Re-link: a new SpecSync command that supports re-linking all scenarios after the Test Cases have been cloned using the Azure DevOps "Copy Test Plan" or "Copy Test Suite" features. (See [feature documentation](features/common-synchronization-features/re-link-scenarios.md) for details.) (#499)
* Source files local scope: The set of scenarios considered for synchronization ("local scope") can be now also specified by specifying the set of feature files using the `local/sourceFiles` setting in the configuration file. (See [Excluding scenarios from synchronization](features/common-synchronization-features/excluding-scenarios-from-synchronization.md) for details.) (#587)
* Filter for feature files: when performing a push or pull command, the execution can be limited to a set of feature files using the `--sourceFileFilter` option. (See [Filters and scopes](important-concepts/filters-and-scopes.md) for details.) (#492)

### Improvements

* Display more details about the synchronization command (e.g. how many Test Cases have been modified, how many Test Cases were up-to-date) (#583)
* Link-only flag for push: you can specify a `--linkOnly` flag to the push command, that skips updating the existing Test Cases, but creates and links new Test Cases for the new scenarios. (#633)
* Create-only flag for pull: you can specify a `--createOnly` flag to the pull command, that skips updating the existing scenarios, but creates new scenarios (in new feature files) for the new Test Cases. (#303)
* The "Automated Test Type" Test Case field is better used: The default value (`Unit Test`) for the "Automated Test Type" Test Case field has been changed. The new default value is `Gherkin` for non-SpecFlow projects and `SpecFlow` for SpecFlow projects. The default value of the field can be changed using the `synchronization/automation/automatedTestType` setting in the configuration file. The change is performed with the next change of the Test Case or can be forced by running the push command with an additional `--force` flag. (#550)
* Work item link tracking: The work item links created by SpecSync are tracked now. This means that if a link was established by SpecSync and the related scenario tag is removed from the feature file, the link will also be removed at the next synchronization. The links created manually or by an earlier version of SpecSync are never removed. (#570)
* All scenario outline examples columns are preserved. If you had a scenario outline with an examples table that contained a column (e.g. "description") that was not used anywhere in the steps, this column was not synchronized to Azure DevOps. Now in this case an additional pseudo-test step is added to the Test Case, in order to preserve all parameters. This behavior can be forced to all scenario outlines or completely disabled using the `synchronization/format/showParameterListStep` configuration setting. (#569)
* Support for Gherkin v22: tagged rules, rule-specific backgrounds (#497)
* Support for Background steps in pull (#611)
* Improved change detection for scenarios (new hash algorithm) (#111)
* Improved possibilities for SpecSync plugins
  * Allow analyzing custom keyword (#552)
  * Allow using class name and method name in test result matchers for detecting data row (#603)
  * Customizable base classes for writing custom test source plugins easier (#557)
  * The test result matcher infrastructure has been adapted to the other "provider-style" services and `TestResultMatcher` has been renamed to `TestResultMatcherProvider` on the plugin interface (#647)
  * More functions defined on the `ILocalTestCaseContainerUpdater` interface (#648)

### Breaking changes <a href="v3-3-0-compatibility" id="v3-3-0-compatibility"></a>

* The scenario hash that is calculated for the Test Cases (saved to the history) is not backwards compatible with v3.2 (see #111). 
  This means that once a Test Case has been updated with v3.3, **when downgrading to v3.2** an additional change will be recorded for the Test Cases. With the normal usage (no downgrade) the change has no impact.
* The support for running **SpecFlow v2** scenarios using the [Test Plan / Test Suite based execution](features/test-result-publishing-features/support-for-azure-devops-test-plan-test-suite-based-test-execution.md) has been removed (ie there is no update provided for the related SpecFlow plugins). You can still publish results from SpecFlow v2 projects using the "publish-test-results" command and can use the v3.2 plugins in combination with the v3.3 synchronizer if necessary. (#571)
* As the default value of the "Automated Test Type" Test Case field has been changed (see #550), you need to explicitly set the `synchronization/automation/automatedTestType` setting to `Unit Test` (the old default value), **when your processes were dependent on the old "Automated Test Type" value**. Usually this value is only informational, so the change will have no impact.
* For scenario outlines with examples table that has columns not used in the steps, SpecSync will automatically add a pseudo-step by default to preserve these values (see #569). If this causes any problems, the feature can be disabled by setting the `synchronization/format/showParameterListStep` configuration setting to `never`. 
* The target framework of the SpecSync SpecFlow plugins has been updated to use .NET Framework 4.7.2 instead of 4.7.1. This should have no impact on the usage. (The SpecSync.AzureDevops.Console package still depends on .NET Framework 4.6.2, this wasn't changed.) (#566)
* The `listFile` and the `stdIn` values in the `local/featureFileSource/type` configuration setting are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use `folder` value in combination with `sourceFiles` setting (#587) instead.
* The `synchronization/links[]/mode` setting is deprecated and will be removed in a future version with the introduction of link synchronization (#570). As the mode had only one possible value, this change will have no impact. Please remove the setting.
* Because of the improved possibilities for SpecSync plugins, the SpecSync plugins created for v3.2 have to be adapted slightly.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Feature tags are duplicated at the scenario on pull (#612)
* Fix: Test Case parameters are not cleared when a Scenario Outline is changed to a normal Scenario (#641)
* Fix: When only non-SpecSync managed fields changed in ADO, but these fields are updated with a customization, scenario is detected to be up-to-date even with --force (392)

## v3.2.13 - 2022/03/10

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Test execution history is not displayed in the History tab of the Test Run (#653)
* Fix: Tests appear multiple times in the 'Tests' tab of the pipeline result when the `VsTest` task is used. To fix this there is a new "SpecSync Tools" Azure DevOps extension, that contains a task "Visual Studio Test for SpecSync" that is a modified version of the `VsTest` task that does not display the result in the 'Tests' tab. (See [How to use the SpecSync Azure DevOps pipeline tasks](important-concepts/how-to-use-the-pipeline-tasks.md) for details.) (#655)

## v3.2.12 - 2022/02/07

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Test Configuration might not be resolved by name when there are more than 200 configurations specified in the project (#629)

* Fix: Scenario Outline results cannot be published when SpecFlow generator is configured with allowRowTests=false for xUnit and NUnit (#602)

## v3.2.9 - 2021/12/08

### Improvements

* The [Ignore non-supported local tags](features/push-features/customization-ignore-non-supported-local-tags.md) customization has been extended to allow specifying the not-supported tags instead of the supported tags in order to handle cases where you want to skip synchronizing certain tags. (#568)
* Override any configuration setting from command line using the `--configOverride` option. See [Override configuration setting from command line](reference/command-line-reference#override-configuration-setting-from-command-line) for details. (#578)

## v3.2.8 - 2021/11/22

### Improvements

* Support for .NET 6 framework when [installed as a .NET tool](installation/dotnet-core-tool.md). (#565)

## v3.2.7 - 2021/11/04

### Improvements

* [Customization: Ignore non-supported local tags](features/push-features/customization-ignore-non-supported-local-tags.md). This customization is useful when the Azure DevOps settings does not allow creating new tags for normal users. With the customization you can specify those tags that are supported in the Azure DevOps project and SpecSync will ignore all other local (scenario) tags. (#538)
* Display currently enabled customizations on the output (#545)
* Allow specifying value for the Automated Test Type field of the Test Case (to override the default `Unit Test`) and be able to select `custom` as automation strategy (useful for non .NET projects) (#549)
* Show error if multiple scenarios are linked to the same Test Case (#546)
* Show error if a scenario has multiple Test Case tags (#553)
* Support for NUnit v2 XML test result file format (#554)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Additional space included to the Test Case title or parts of the title is missing when the local test case title contains a colon and synchronized from a plugin (#551)
* Fix: JSON schema for the configuration file does not allow `:` in tag expressions (#536)

## v3.2.6 - 2021/09/09

### Improvements

* Use build/release queue user as test "run by" identity (#510)
* Support for SpecFlow v3.8, v3.9 (#531)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Last test result indicator is not visible in Azure DevOps test suite screen for ADO2019 or earlier (#530)
* Fix: Suite name requires to be unique across all plans even is test plan specified (#513)
* Fix: Test result publishing might not publish results to Test Plans with more than 200 Test Suites (#496)
* Fix: Duplicate test results published with multi-suite publish customization (#502)
* Fix: Test results are not associated with the result when invoked from a release pipeline (#507)

## v3.2.5 - 2021/07/01

### Improvements

* Show license info in "version" command. With the option `--bare`, only the version number is displayed. (See [version](reference/command-line-reference/version-command.md) command.) (#462)
* Show custom value for empty "expected result" using `synchronization/format/emptyExpectedResultValue` setting. (See [format](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/configuration-synchronization-format.md) settings.) (#456)
* Allow specifying additional labels for work item links in tags, separated by a semicolon, like `@bug:456:argument_error_for_empty_input`. (See [Linking Work Items using tags](features/common-synchronization-features/linking-work-items-with-tags.md#work-item-tags).) (#460)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Behave test results not detected when scenario outline placeholder is used in the title (#470)
* Fix: Unable to create link for PRs in another project (#458)
* Fix: Unhandled error "Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'gherkinDialect')" for invalid feature files (#469)

## v3.2.4 - 2021/05/21

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Test statistics are not displayed on stage summary for staged builds (#448)
* Fix: Published tests are not displayed in the "Tests" tab of the build result (see [Use SpecSync from build or release pipeline](important-concepts/synchronizing-test-cases-from-build.md#publishing-test-results-from-build-or-release-pipeline) for details) (#453)

## v3.2.3 - 2021/04/29

### Improvements

* Include interface code documentation for plugin dependencies (#450)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Error during synchronization for very long project, feature or scenario names (#439)
* Fix: Python Behave skipped status is not mapped, pending is not recognized (#427)

* Fix: Attached images are not numbered using test case step number, when useExpectedResult is enabled (#440)
* Fix: Zip packages use incompatible path references for Linux (#437)
* Fix: Synchronizing scenarios with "<" character causes the test case to display incorrectly (#451)

## v3.2.2 - 2021/03/16

### Improvements

* Display more diagnostic information when no test results were published (#425)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Test step results are published incorrectly when `useExpectedResult` format option is enabled and the scenario has more than 2 Then step (#422)

## v3.2.1 - 2021/03/09

### New features

* [Customization: Automatically link changed Test Cases](features/push-features/customization-automatically-link-changed-test-cases.md) (#412)

### Improvements

* Support SpecSync plugins in .NET Framework runner ([SpecSync.AzureDevOps.Console package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecSync.AzureDevOps.Console)). (#415)
* Support for Jest with jest-cucumber. You need to use `jestCucumberXml` as a publish format. (#395)
* SpecFlow step-level messages are displayed in the test result (#402)
* SpecFlow+ Runner results can be published with Free and Standard editions (#404)
* Support for SpecFlow v3.7 (#414)

### Bug fixes

* Fix: Multi-line step messages are displayed without line separators (#411)
* Fix: Invalid ADO parameter data causes synchronization to stop (#413)

## v3.2.0 - 2021/01/26

### New features

* Publish execution result details as Test Run iterations with step results and the standard output of the tests is also attached to the test result. Step results are published only if the result format supports it (currently for SpecFlow results and Cucumber JSON). (#317, #318)
* Support for new test result formats: Cucumber JSON (works with all Cucumbers), Cucumber.js XML and Cypress JSON files. See all supported formats at in the [Compatibility](reference/compatibility.md#supported-test-result-formats) page. (#349, #341)
* Support publishing test result attachments. Currently supported for TRX and Cucumber JSON result formats. (#122, #360)
* [Customization: Allow reset Test Case state](features/push-features/customization-reset-test-case-state-after-change.md) after change as a separate work item update based on tags. This is useful for example when the Test Case has to be marked as `Ready` if the scenario is tagged with `@ready`, but when work item updates are not allowed in `Ready` state. See [Customization: Reset Test Case state after change](features/push-features/customization-reset-test-case-state-after-change.md) for details. (#378)
* Support .NET 5. The SpecSync [.NET Core Tool](installation/dotnet-core-tool.md) package now also contains a .NET 5 version. The .NET Core 3.1 is still available and can also be used. (#340)

### Improvements

* Support for linking pull requests using tags. To link a pull request, you have to [configure a link synchronization](features/common-synchronization-features/linking-work-items-with-tags.md) with a prefix and with `relationship` set to `Pull Request`. (#388)
* Allow publishing multiple test result files. The test results from the multiple files are going to be merged and published as a single test run. You can list multiple files and directories using the `-r` (`--testResultFile`) option separated by semicolons (`;`). See [Publishing test result files](features/test-result-publishing-features/publishing-test-result-files.md#merging-multiple-test-result-files) for details. (#343)
* Support for SpecFlow v3.5 (#353)
* Support for SpecFlow v3.6 (#391)
* Improved custom update templates: remove description indent, allow scenario/feature source text to be used, allow Rule name and description to be used, can use Gherkin-independent placeholder names (#347, #323)
* Allow environment variables to be used in custom update and custom default template in `{env:ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}` format. (#348)
* Improve error message in case of insufficient PAT authorization scope issue (#124)
* Use folder file source when SpecSync is invoked from a non-dotnet folder and improve error message if it is invoked from the wrong folder. This way you can start using SpecSync for non-dotnet projects without specifying `local` settings in configuration. (#342)
* Allow setting `System.History` field (appears as "Discussion" in Azure DevOps) with custom field updates (#324)
* Use the test configuration of the test suite if there is only one assigned by default for publishing test results. Supported only with Azure DevOps Services, on older versions the configuration has to be specified explicitly with the `-c` (`--testConfiguration`) option or in the config file. (#321)
* Displaying release date, warn if an outdated release is used (#375)
* State change (`synchronization/state/setValueOnChangeTo`) can be limited to scenarios using tag expressions. Can be used together with the Reset Test Case state customization. (#379)
* Improve error reporting of publish-test-results (#350)

### Breaking changes

* Make sub-result publish optional. Because of the improved iteration details publishing (see above), SpecSync will not automatically publish Scenario Outline iterations as sub-results (sub-results are not displayed on Azure DevOps UI, but can be retrieved using the Azure DevOps API). Publishing sub-results can be enabled with `publishTestResults/createSubResults`. (#339)
* Use `condition` instead `skipForTags` in `synchronization/automation` configuration setting. The condition should contain the negated expression of the `skipForTags`, e.g. `not @manual`. (#381)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Circular parent config files causes Stack Overflow (#316)
* Fix: Too long examples lines might cause xUnit TRX results unable to load (#361)
* Fix: SDK-style .NET project files with explicitly listed feature file references using wildcards are not supported (#216)
* Fix: SpecSync assemblies have non-real date in PE header timestamp (#368)

## v3.1.2 - 2021/03/09

### Improvements

* Support SpecSync plugins in .NET Framework runner (SpecSync.AzureDevOps.Console package). (#415)
* Improve error message in case of insufficient PAT authorization scope issue (#124)
* Displaying release date, warn if an outdated release is used (#375)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Circular parent config files causes Stack Overflow (#316)
* Fix: Invalid ADO parameter data causes synchronization to stop (#413)

## v3.1.1 - 2021/01/05

### Improvements

* Parameters of Scenario Outlines are not visible in published test results if there are only one example. (#320)
* Support localized Azure DevOps processes: set `toolSettings/testCaseWorkItemName` and `toolSettings/testSuiteWorkItemName` configuration settings (#315)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Test Cases synchronized from non-SpecFlow project cannot be marked as automated (#345)
* Fix: Test Run automation status is not set on TFS2017 (#352)

## v3.1.0 - 2020/10/26

### New features & improvements

* SpecSync plugin support. See [SpecSync Plugins](features/general-features/specsync-plugins.md) for details. (#110)
* Allow users to enter their credentials interactively in the .NET Core based installations (#298)
* Allow users to save their user name or PAT to the user-specific configuration if they have entered them interactively (#297)
* Non-zero exit code is returned on warnings (#285)
* Force SpecSync tool to exit with zero exit code even in case of warnings using the `--zeroExitCodeForWarnings` flag. (#301)
* Ignore specified Azure DevOps Test Case tags (they are not going to be removed even if there is no corresponding tag on the scenario) See [Customization: Ignoring Test Case Tags](features/push-features/customization-ignoring-test-case-tags.md) for details. (#305)
* Allow ignoring SSL certificate errors for a trusted certificate (#290)
* Show warning when feature files have became invalid after synchronization (#286)
* Diagnostic categories can be specified on command line. The support team might ask you to configure this for diagnosing special integration issues. (#234)
* Allow specifying the SpecSync compatibility version in configuration files. The compatibility version specifies the SpecSync version that the configuration file was created for. The new SpecSync features can be used even if the compatibility version is older than the current version, but if the default values of some settings change in the future, SpecSync will not apply these default unless the compatibility version is updated. (#312)
* Allow to override Run Type setting of the published Test Run (handling automation mismatch error) (#125)

### Breaking changes

* The setting `--baseFolder` becomes obsolete. It can be still used in v3.1 but it is going to be removed in a future release. As an alternative, you can set the working directory of the SpecSync tool. (#311)
* The setting `--diag` becomes obsolete. It can be still used in v3.1 but it is going to be removed in a future release. As an alternative, you should use the equivalent `--verbose` (or `-v`) options. (#309)

### Bug Fixes

All bug fixes od v3.0.3 are also included in this release.

* Fix: Test Case change is not detected if it only contains a link removal and there are no other field changes
* Fix: Make "assemblyBasedExecution" strategy as default (#313)

## v3.0.3 - 2020/10/23

### Improvements

* `--verbose` option also displays diagnostic messages (equivalent to `--diag`). The `--diag` option will become obsolete in v3.1. (#310)
* Display config file being used (#304)
* Suggest checking the [troubleshooting](contact/troubleshooting.md) page on error (#227)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Misleading error message when the SpecFlow tools folder is not configured/detected correctly (#300)
* Fix: Should load user-specific config file even if `ignoreParentConfig` is set to true (#306)
* Fix: When [multi-suite-publish customization](features/test-result-publishing-features/customization-publishing-test-results-to-multiple-test-suite.md) is used, the enforcement of specifying a Test Suite is unnecessary (#299)
* Fix: Test cases with more than 200 history item cause synchronization error (#123)
* Fix: Package name is displayed instead of product name in the command line tool (#307)

## v3.0.2 - 2020/09/03

{% hint style="warning" %}
v3.0.1 released earlier on the same day has been deprecated due to a bug for specifying log files. Please use v3.0.2.
{% endhint %}

### Improvements

* Display Support Code: There is a 5-letter support code displayed in the synchronization output for licensed users. Please provide the support code for reporting incidents or license renewal.
* **Publish official SpecSync Docker image**: There are pre-built official Docker images available at [https://hub.docker.com/r/specsolutions/specsync](https://hub.docker.com/r/specsolutions/specsync) that are ready-to-use for synchronizing scenarios or publishing test results. See [Install as Docker image](installation/docker-image.md) for details.
* Improvement: detect unchanged Test Case steps and do not show them in Test Case history
* Set "Run By" field on publish-test-results
* Support SpecFlow v3.4 with Test Suite based execution with Scenario Outline wrappers strategy, using NuGet package: [SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.3-4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.3-4)
* .NET Core binaries are also distributed as [downloadable](downloads.md) zip package

### Bug Fixes

* Fix: Config file settings cannot be overridden from command line if they contain invalid path
* Fix: Configuration error causes exit code 90 (unhandled error) instead of 100
* Fix: SpecSync removes UTF-8 BOM header from the file on link
* Fix: Gherkin Rule keyword is not supported (no scenarios found in file)
* Fix: Invalid Build ID detected from build or release pipeline
* Fix: Unnecessary whitespace at the bottom of DocString (fix applies at the next scenario change unless you perform a push with `--force`)
* Fix: Error when log file does not exist (found in v3.0.1)

## v3.0.0 - 2020/07/24

## v2.0.0 - 2019/01/14

### Breaking changes

* The product has been renamed to SpecSync for Azure DevOps to be conform with the updated product name of Microsoft TFS/VSTS
* The NuGet package has been renamed and split:
  * `SpecSync.AzureDevOps` - contains the synchronization tool
  * `SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.2-3`, `SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlow.2-4`, etc. - contains the SpecFlow plugin required to [synchronized automated test cases](important-concepts/synchronizing-automated-test-cases.md) for a particular SpecFlow version (eg. v2.3, v2.4).
  * `SpecSync.MTM` - obsolete package, will load SpecSync.AzureDevOps, SpecSync.AzureDevOps.SpecFlowPlugin has to be added manually if necessary
* The synchronization tool has been renamed from `SpecSync4MTM` to `SpecSync4AzureDevOps`
* The configuration of the synchronization has been moved to a configuration file (although a few options can be overridden from the command line). By default the config file should be named as `specsync.json`. See configuration options and samples at [Configuration](reference/configuration/).
* The two-way synchronization has been reworked to be able to support a more stable development process. The synchronization has been split into two independent actions: _push_ and _pull_. The new process should follow a pull-merge/resolve-verify-push model. See [Two-way synchronization](features/pull-features/two-way-synchronization.md) for details.
* Tag filtering has been split to _tag filter_ and _tags scope_. Tag filter has to be specified on the command line (`--tagFilter`), while tag scope has to be specified in the config file (`local/tags`). See [Filters and scopes](important-concepts/filters-and-scopes.md) for details.
* If a scenario was linked to a test case that does not exist, SpecSync reports this as an error (in v1 it linked to a new scenario and replaced the wrong tag)
* The 'state' field of the test case is set to the value provided in configuration `synchronization/state/setValueOnChangeTo` not only when the test case changed (v1) but also when the test case is created.
* The default way of generating test method wrappers has changed to `iterateThroughExamples`. See [`specFlow` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-specflow.md) for details.

### New features

* Support for specifying test case field default values and custom field updates. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for skipping the `Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` prefixes in test case title. See [`synchronization` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/).
* Test case tag prefix name (by default `tc`) can be configured. See [`synchronization/format` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-synchronization/configuration-synchronization-format.md).
* Support for ignoring test case steps with a specific prefix text. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for synchronization of scenarios on a feature branch. See [`customizations` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-customizations.md).
* Support for folder-based synchronization. See [`local` configuration](reference/configuration/configuration-local.md).
* SpecSync can track format configuration changes and automatically re-sync scenarios without the `--force` option.
* More readable sync trace output.&#x20;
