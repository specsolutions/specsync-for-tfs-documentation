# Using SpecSync with Cucumber

SpecSync can synchronize any scenarios that are written in Gherkin format. Gherkin format is used by many tools in many platforms, like Cucumber, Cucumber Java, Cucumber.js, Behat, Behave and also SpecFlow.

SpecSync can also be used to publish test results of various Cucumber projects including Cucumber Java, Behave and SpecFlow so that Azure DevOps can track the historical test executions and provide you with various reports. To be able to publish the test results, the [publish-test-result](../reference/command-line-reference/publish-test-results-command.md) command has to be used.

The SpecSync synchronization tool can be executed as a command line tool from Windows, macOS and Linux-based systems. See [Installation & Setup](../installation/) and [Using SpecSync on macOS or Linux](using-specsync-on-osxlinux-page.md) pages for details.

For a detailed guide on how to setup and run SpecSync with Cucumber, please check the [Getting started using Cucumber or other Gherkin-based BDD tool](../getting-started/getting-started-cucumber.md) guide.
