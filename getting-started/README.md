# Getting started

SpecSync for Azure DevOps synchronizes the scenarios of a BDD \(e.g. SpecFlow or Cucumber\) project with the test cases of an Azure DevOps project. For the supported Azure DevOps versions, please check the [Compatibility](../reference/compatibility.md) list.

The necessary steps are slightly different depending on whether you use SpecSync with SpecFlow \(.NET\) or with other Gherkin-based BDD tools, like Cucumber. Please follow the guide for your context.
